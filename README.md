# Census-Income-Prediction
Building a classification model for predicting the income using the Adult Census Income Dataset.

# Overview:
In this notebook, we are going to predict whether a person's income is above 50k or below 50k using various features like age, education, and occupation.

# Motivation:
Building such predictive models can help us better understand the population of a country as well as the various factors affecting the growth in the economy.
Governments can understand such factors and improve upon them leading to the growth of the country.

# Conclusion:
In this project, we build various models like logistic regression, knn classifier, support vector classifier, decision tree classifier, random forest classifier and xgboost classifier.
A hyperparameter tuned random forest classifier gives the highest accuracy score of 92.77 and f1 score of 93.08.

# Future Work:
We have a large enough dataset, so we can use neural networks such as an artificial neural network to build a model which can result in better performa
